Last night I had dinner (pho) with Janice and Lydia. It felt really good to
share perspectives on unconventional career and life choices. Afterwards, I
stopped by RC to pick up my laptop; I joined a small group who were enjoying a
funny conversation about technical and work situations. I could not stop
laughing after someone was described as a "human generator of technical debt."

Today, I connected to two of the servers of RC's community cluster via SSH.
Robert showed me how to view GPU usage on them. He is running Jupyter notebooks
on these servers. I told him about
[JupyterHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub) and
[BinderHub](https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub), just in case. We also
exchanged a few words in German, which was fun. Over lunch, I met two
interesting characters (spoke Italian and a couple words of Serbian).

Again, I only read a few pages of "Statistical Rethinking" (yes, I'm the
slowest reader in the world). I participated in a very rich PGP/GPG session led
by Ernest. I learnt that I could connect to a remote server using my
authentication GPG subkey instead of my SSH key! Also, I'm happy to expand my
tiny [web of trust](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=vindex&search=0xB3C71FE3771F4D2F)!

Tonight, we had presentations as well as an insipiring, challenging, reassuring
talk by Sonali (RC faculty) about our educational journey. Danielle gave a
colourful demo, which prompted thoughts about the line between functionality
(here, implemented in Rust) and rendering (here, implemented in JS). I secured
a pair programming session with Danielle tomorrow, yay!
