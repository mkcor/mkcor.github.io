I have done a little paid work remotely, because

* I wouldn't drop the ball on this data science project and
* a little extra cash definitely won't hurt.

This morning, I gladly helped Brad with his font rendering by being the rubber
duck. Brad is building this very cool, professional-looking
[weather reporter](https://github.com/redSlug/weather-reporter). Indirectly,
this reminded of the importance of free/libre fonts, which I first heard about
at LibrePlanet 2015 (talk by
[Dave Grossland](https://libreplanet.org/2015/program/speakers.html#crossland)).
I've never taken the time to dig deeper, but one day I may.

Today, I skipped the afternoon at RC to meet my parents at the airport: They
are visiting for three days! I'm very happy to get to spend some time with
them. I'm actually a little heartbroken about leaving my former place (and the
people), even though moving to the new place is improving my overall living
situation. So, I'm grateful for my parents' support when dealing with the mixed
emotions. I'm also super excited to be showing them what I like/know of NYC!
