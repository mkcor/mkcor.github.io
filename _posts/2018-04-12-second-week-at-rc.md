I'd like to thank [Ashley](http://bits.ashleyblewer.com/) for letting me know
about [Mozilla Fellowships](https://foundation.mozilla.org/fellowships/apply/)!
I want to apply but I'm not sure under which profile: open web, tech policy, or
science/research.  I'm all three! My first leaning would be science/research,
but I'm an *independent* researcher affiliated *only* with
[IGDORE](https://igdore.org/). I reached out and it should be fine, as long as
I highlight my academic connections as well.

Today, I'm proud to share that I'll be a
[speaker](https://scipy2018.scipy.org/ehome/299527/712461/) at SciPy 2018!
My collaborator [Konstantinos](http://personal.lse.ac.uk/vamourel/) and I will
also contribute a paper to the conference proceedings. I feel very excited but
also overwhelmed with all my projects. This week, I've invested in physicality
because it's so good and balancing and necessary. I'm sore from an intro class
to aerial hoop and it feels great. Acrobatics is dreamy, isn't it?

I have put the final touch to my long-lived
[pull request](https://github.com/quelledanielle/color-me-rusty/pull/2).
Finally. Admittedly, there isn't much going on, but it's served as a good
pretext to engage in meta-level considerations and in-person conversations. At
some point this afternoon, I joined a session about lambda calculus... We find
some of the abstraction and expressiveness of lambda calculus in functional
programming languages.

We thought we could view imperative programming (where you execute instructions
with explicit control flow) as bottom-up and declarative programming (where you
evaluate expressions with no explicit control flow) as top-down. We wondered
how the hardware related to the way you compute. This reminded me of a talk I
didn't fully understand back at LibrePlanet 2017:
[The Lisp machine and GNU](https://media.libreplanet.org/u/libreplanet/m/the-lisp-machine-and-gnu/).
