This morning, I braced myself and made a fresh pot of coffee at RC. The
algorithm was taped on the coffee machine. That was easy (just follow the
instructions) but, somehow, doing something for the first time is always a
little intimidating. Sarah and I had a nice conversation about this phenomenon
in tech, whenever we start using a new language or framework. Really, everyone
gets started the same way, looking the new tool up and following the docs.

Brad brought some breakfast to share. What a treat! I joined Noah and Sean in
their discussion about web apps for launching, monitoring, retrieving
(possibly heavy-duty) scientific computing jobs (such as image processing).
They talked about [Wasm](http://webassembly.org/), which I would install later
today. I told Noah about [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and
[Dash](https://github.com/plotly/dash), and we agreed to have a study jam on
multi-threaded programming. At some point.

This afternoon, I joined a conversation about implicit type conversion in
Python. Then, I pair-programmed with Danielle on her
[colourful project](https://github.com/quelledanielle/color-me-rusty) which
uses Rust and Wasm together. We wanted to add leading zeroes to the RGB values
so that they always display as three digits (and the overall text has constant
width). My JavaScript is so rusty, but I was okay under Danielle's guidance.

I discovered the syntactic sugar of
[template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
and got a refresher on how to
[raise (throw) errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Error).
I pushed my habit for defensive programming, i.e., including
[expectation checks](https://github.com/quelledanielle/color-me-rusty/commit/76cefe0f5f1941b41b5d63c52f114d15939e413c#diff-168726dbe96b3ce427e7fedce31bb0bcR25).
Oh, I have to get going because I want attend the non-technical presentations
RCers are giving now!
