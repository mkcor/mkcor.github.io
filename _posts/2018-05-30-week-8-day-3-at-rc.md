Today was busy (errands, appointments, events).
[Data & Society](https://datasociety.net/) were having a happy hour but I only
managed to stop by for two minutes. Apparently, June will be packed with
more events! At Data & Society, even an elevator conversation can bring out the
word 'systemically' (which is largely why I had applied for their
[fellows program](https://datasociety.net/initiatives/fellows-program/) at the
last minute, on January 15, 2018).

I had a much longer conversation in the afternoon: Jennifer wanted to ask me
about the [Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), which I am always happy to
present and promote! Jennifer is a bright, humble, driven software engineer who
has *scaled* machine-learning pipelines at Google (wow). She has built
infrastructure to manage and process sensor data (think massive and real-time).

This is the kind of people you get to meet at RC. We discussed the following:

* scientists vs engineers (a
[reference](https://www.software.ac.uk/index.php/blog/2016-09-26-scientific-coding-and-software-engineering-whats-difference))
* labour, work, and action ([Arendt](https://www.iep.utm.edu/arendt/#SH4a))
* ethics and politics ([Aristotle](https://www.iep.utm.edu/aris-pol/))
* politics vs the political, which sounds better in Romance languages, e.g.,
lo político y la política ([Schmitt](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/#ConPolCriLib), [Mouffe](https://www.webdianoia.com/contemporanea/mouffe/mouffe_lopolitico.htm))
* And much more...
