So I wanted to experiment with Jekyll. I found it was very fast and smooth to
get started with, so from now on I will recommend it to my non-technical
friends who (want to) write blogs. To technical friends alike, I should say.

I mentioned non-technical friends because I like to increase the general level
of tech literacy. Not that technical/non-technical would be a binary thing...
Not *at all*. Anyway, I feel Jekyll lets you tunnel through lots of technical
things without requiring much prior knowledge.

I may have a huge blind spot but, hopefully, I will find out shortly. I cannot
wait to see writers pick up technologies such as Git, GitHub, Markdown and
principles such as versioning, configuring, building, ...

Now that I have played with Jekyll a little, I feel so lazy about updating my
existing [personal website](https://marianne-corvellec.appspot.com/). It is
only a static page, it was built with [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/), it
looks low-tech but I actually like it this way.

I will let you know what happens once I make up my mind. In the meantime, let
me wish you a Happy New Year!
