I've been walking the City in
[high heels](https://doi.org/10.1080/10253866.2016.1153830), which is not
healthy nor sustainable. Today, I gave my ankles and body a break. I also took
the day off programming-wise, to focus on (and work out) my banking and housing
issues.

I welcomed an interruption by the post-lunch prep problem debrief (mentioned
[yesterday]({% post_url 2018-04-10-week-2-day-2-at-rc %})), since that brought
some code into my day! I happily spread the word about
[type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) in Python 3. Like
many, I remember their announcement by Guido at PyCon 2015. Personally, I
started using them in 2017.

Today, I looked up how to write
[internal links](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/#linking-to-posts) in
Markdown with Jekyll (in order to link 'yesterday' in the previous paragraph to
yesterday's post). Life is good. I've been meeting lots of potential new
friends, which I'm very grateful for.
