So, this is my last week at RC and in NYC. It is intense! I have been running
around, soaking up the sun, saying farewell to the places and people I love...

In the background, I'm constantly thinking about my SciPy presentation. Coding
is so helpful: My fingers pull my brain, which in turn can pull my fingers.

Today, I paired with Nick to replace the LCD screen of my phone (I dropped it a
couple weeks ago, which cracked the screen). We did it, yay! And it only took
us about 20 minutes! My phone looks brand new again. This experience made my
day and it builds confidence: We don't have to be so afraid of breaking things,
because we are capable of repairing them. Let me give a shout-out to
[iFixit](https://www.ifixit.com/) as well.
