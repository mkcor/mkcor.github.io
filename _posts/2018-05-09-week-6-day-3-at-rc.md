Today was similar to [yesterday]({% post_url 2018-05-08-week-6-day-2-at-rc %}),
writing the proceedings paper. I was reminded that, when using BibTeX, you
need to compile twice for the citation to render.

I used `git add -i` for the first time! It is useful for making very granular
commits. If you are afraid of getting too granular, don't be, because you can
always squash commits later on (you can always zoom out, but you cannot zoom in
if you do not have finer resolution). This
[documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Interactive-Staging)
held my hand. I love that you can split hunks! Maybe I should update my
personal informal
[cheatsheet](https://gist.github.com/mkcor/5733a25575bf0ca61d4947d9837bb43f).

Tomorrow will be our last day with the Spring 1 batch, which also means that we
(Spring 2) are halfway through at RC...
