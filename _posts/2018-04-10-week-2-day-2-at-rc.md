My body is craving some dancing and exercising. I had signed up for a
flexibility class this morning (I want to get my splits back and improve my
back flexibility) but I got there too late! I thought I had padded my commute
time generously enough, but apparently not. Anything can happen with the NYC
subways (e.g., the M train turns into a J train at some point).

Today I caught myself having destructive thoughts such as "everyone here is so
good and is getting stuff done and is studying a Lisp language seriously... and
I'm not!" But I know it is very common, so I try not to worry and just keep
going with my day. Today, I had to follow up on a few things related to my paid
work, as well as my banking and housing situations.

So, it's frustrating that I could not join the group of RCers who gathered to
listen (live) to Mark Zuckerberg testifying before the US Senate but, well,
there are only 24 hours in a day. Kudos to Ethan for coming up with this
initiative though! I started reading about
[hash tables](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/data-structures/hash-tables/basics-of-hash-tables/tutorial/)
to refresh my understanding, but I did not actually participate in the
post-lunch prep problems (which Bryan awesomely curates every day).

I picked up my JavaScript
[work in progress](https://github.com/quelledanielle/color-me-rusty/pull/2)
where I had left it. I was confronted with typing questions again, since our
RGB values are not stored in just any array, but in a *typed*
[`Uint8ClampedArray`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Uint8ClampedArray).
I definitely don't want to be casual about converting its [0, 255]-range
integers into strings... Hence the
[discussion](https://github.com/quelledanielle/color-me-rusty/pull/2#discussion_r180557833).
This brought up more general thoughts about collaboration (in principle and in
practice).

I was delighted to learn about GitHub's
[co-authorship support](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/)
from Danielle, who learnt it from other RCers! I love co-authoring. As I have
previously shared in private communication, I don't agree with the old dusty
traditional academic thinking that *co-authorship* would be less prestigious
than *authorship*; actually, I have opposite views: I feel honoured to
co-author with my colleagues and collaborators (in this case, Danielle).
