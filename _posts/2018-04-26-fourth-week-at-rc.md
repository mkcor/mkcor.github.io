Four weeks already! I have come to the realization that I do *not* want to stay
in NYC beyond my batch at RC. It's a great feeling.

Today was Demo Day at RC. I signed up to demo the work I did
[last week]({% post_url 2018-04-16-week-3-day-1-at-rc %}). I titled it "Data
analysis pipelining with Travis CI." Although, at the moment, I have automated
only few steps which happen very downstream in the pipeline, I communicated the
general vision as I demo'd changing a few words in the source
[notebook](https://github.com/mkcor/case_studies_Py/blob/master/rosi_py/rosi_py.ipynb),
pushing this change into `origin master` (it's actually okay because this repo
is a fork, so I have no use for my `master` branch... except for demos),
monitoring the
[build](https://travis-ci.org/mkcor/case_studies_Py/builds) thus triggered, and
seeing the resulting change in the
[PDF export](https://mkcor.github.io/case_studies_Py/rosi_py/rosi_py.pdf).

The vision is exactly that of
[reproducible research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducibility#Reproducible_research).
It relates more generally to
[Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science)
and [DataOps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DataOps). Anyhow, I got a lot of
love (notably, a sweet hug with Janice). Thank you!

Ancora sul tema dell'amore, oggi ho mangiato la Nutella... direttamente dal
barattolo. Ne rimastava poco, quindi mi sono presa il tempo per finirla
correttamente.
