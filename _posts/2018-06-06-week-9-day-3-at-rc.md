I got my periods on Monday, which reminded me that I support
[menstrual leave](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/health/period-pain-paid-time-off-policy.html).
I didn't take any pain killer. I embraced whatever was happening, I worked less
than usual, and I was okay. I was actually very happy, for it proved I was able
to unwind over the weekend (as I could feel, sense, experience). I shared
gleeful conversations about menstruations with other female Recursers.


I helped a friend who needed a letter translated into French. It was full of
legal language, so I learnt a lot when looking up or double-checking suitable,
equivalent terms. Lately, I have been very excited for the new government in
Italy[^1]! I have been feeling a little anxious about my finances, from booking
flights as well as experiencing this kind of
[frustration](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/2017-reimbursements.html).

[^1]: Non ho ancora finito di ascoltare il
      [discorso](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY8SzSOqxz8) del premier.

On the [SciPy 2018](https://scipy2018.scipy.org) front, at least, things are
boding well for my reimbursement. My European networks reminded me of
[EuroSciPy 2018](https://www.euroscipy.org/2018/) and now I feel like going...
Like so many FLOSS developers, I have been shocked by the news that
[Microsoft is acquiring GitHub](https://blog.github.com/2018-06-04-github-microsoft/).
This very blog is hosted on GitHub: I should probably move it, before
everything breaks.

Today, I got started with Eugene's current project, an R package called
[`gestalt`](https://github.com/egnha/gestalt). If only for the name, you want
to try it, right? `gestalt` lets you compose functions in a powerful way, and
it is so function-centric it is irresistible. Eugene is a mathematician by
training and it is a pleasure to beta-test his work. To add to the R love, I
also helped out a (non-RC) friend with an R script.
