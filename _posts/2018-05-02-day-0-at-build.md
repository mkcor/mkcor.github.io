Today, I was not at RC. I flew into St. Louis, MO (making Missouri, by the way,
the tenth US state where I'm spending, say, more than 24 hours). My body and
soul are more than happy to get a break from the City (living in the City is
like holding your breath almost all the time).

What brought me here was an invitation to participate in a one-day event,
[BUILD](http://politicaldatascience.com/BUILD/), organized by the Department of
Political Science at [WUSTL](https://wustl.edu/). We are going to analyze data
from/about US mayors. I'm excited to contribute my data visualization skills. I
love being surrounded by political scientists... Feeling so honoured and
privileged.
