Today, I struggled waking and booting my laptop, but eventually I could use it
normally. I continued with the following works in progress:

* reading "Statistical Rethinking" and
* setting up continuous integration (CI) in a data analysis
[project](https://github.com/bayesways/case_studies_Py/issues/4).

The task I'm currently working on automating is about generating a PDF file. I
want to ship this build artifact back to GitHub or maybe elsewhere, but I'm not
sure [where](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/#Supported-Providers)
yet. Apparently, there is more than one obvious
[way](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/2324#issuecomment-43437398)
to do it.

I noticed that, even if I rebase in Git (which rewrites commit history), Travis
CI keeps the build history. So, all the builds that were ever started for my
repo still live [here](https://travis-ci.org/mkcor/case_studies_Py/builds). I
like that (sense of security). I will add the cute little
[badge](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/status-images/) showing build status,
of course. I love badges.

Today, I also spent some time with a friend whom I've known for over a decade.
Familiarity feels wonderful, especially in a period of transition and
instability. In the end, contrary to what I
[wrote]({% post_url 2018-04-12-second-week-at-rc %}) a few days ago, I have
decided *not* to apply to be a Mozilla Fellow. The reasons are threefold:

* I don't have time to put together a good submission (deadline being this
Friday);
* I don't have "academic institutional affiliation" as per the preference
expressed in the
[FAQ](https://foundation.mozilla.org/opportunity/fellowships/);
* Mozilla Fellowships are for
[*emerging* leaders](https://foundation.mozilla.org/fellowships/apply/), but
"[I am] already emerged," [Ashley](http://bits.ashleyblewer.com/) said (lol).
